Please generate the following folders for the storage of training results:
`biolord`, `GEARS`, `Scouter`

Note that completely reproducible results are not guaranteed across PyTorch release. Given differen machines (e.g. different GPU cards or CPU), you might see a slightly but not drastically different result. 

The attached `.csv` files are the model performance results for generating the plots in the manuscript, obtained from running on NVIDIA A40 GPU.
